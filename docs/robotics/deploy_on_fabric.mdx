FABRIC is OpenMind's decentralized machine-to-machine coordination and communication system. To deploy your robot on FABRIC using OM1, follow these steps:

## 1. Obtain Identity and Keys

Before configuring your robot, you need to register it and get the necessary credentials.

### Get an API Key
1. Go to the [OpenMind Portal](https://portal.openmind.org/).
2. Sign up or log in to generate your **API Key**.

### Join FABRIC and Get a URID
1. Navigate to the [Robots section of the Portal](https://portal.openmind.org/robots).
2. Enter your machine's metadata (currently just an arbitrary string to identify your robot).
3. Click "Join".
4. The system will generate a **Universal Robot ID (URID)**.
   - Format: Starts with `OM`, followed by 12 alphanumeric characters (e.g., `OM742d35Cc6634`).
   - This ID allows your robot to communicate with others on the FABRIC network.

## 2. Configure Your Robot

You need to update your robot's configuration file in the OM1 repository.

1. Locate your robot's config file in the `config/` directory (e.g., `config/turtlebot4.json5` or `config/spot.json5`).
2. Open the file and update the `api_key` and `URID` fields.

```json5
{
  "version": "v1.0.1",
  "name": "my_robot_name",
  "api_key": "YOUR_OPENMIND_API_KEY", // Replace with your actual API Key
  "URID": "YOUR_URID",                 // Replace with your generated URID (e.g., OM742d35Cc6634)
  // ... other settings
}
```

### Alternative: Using Environment Variables
You can also set these values using a `.env` file in the root of the project to avoid hardcoding them in the config file.

```bash
OM_API_KEY=om1_live_...
URID=OM742d35Cc6634
```

## 3. Run OM1

Once configured, launch the OM1 agent with your robot's profile.

```bash
uv run src/run.py <robot_profile_name>
```

Example for TurtleBot4:
```bash
uv run src/run.py turtlebot4
```

## 4. Verification

To verify your robot is successfully deployed and connected:
- **WebSim**: Open `http://localhost:8000/` to visualize your robot's state and debug.
- **Console Logs**: Check the logs for successful connection messages to the OpenMind server and FABRIC network.
